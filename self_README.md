This repository will contain my work for several different RL environments.

Here is the link to the gymnasium API, which you will use to get better at RL for now:

Here is a link to a repository that contains several really cool RL environments
you may want to try making agents for later:

To activate the conda environment for gymnasium, run this command:
conda activate gymnasium
